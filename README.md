# Tetris 

## What I've done
I've made Tetris with it's original features. Rotating the shapes, clearing the rows, etc. I've added a score and the ability to see the next shape. The controls are basic,
move left or right with the **LEFT** and **RIGHT** keys and rotating the shape pressing the **UP** key. You can also speed up the falling pressing the **DOWN** key.

## What I hope to implement
Maybe music and some sound effects.
