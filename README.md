# Tetris 

## What I've done
I've made Tetris with it's original features. Rotating the shapes, clearing the rows, etc. I've added a score and the ability to see the next shape. The controls are basic,
move left or right with their corespondent keys (Left and Right arrows) and rotating the shape pressing the **UP** key. You can also speed up the falling pressing the **DOWN** key.

## What I hope to implement
Add the option to replay the game.
